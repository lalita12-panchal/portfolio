## 🌐 Deployment

### 🔥 Recommended: Vercel

1. Login to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) with GitHub
2. Import your repo
3. Build Command → `npm run build`
4. Output Directory → `build` (or `dist`)
5. Deploy → Your live URL is ready 🎉

### Alternatives


* **GitHub Pages** — use `gh-pages` for CRA apps

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

For contact forms or APIs, create a `.env` file (excluded from Git):

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

On hosting platforms, configure these via dashboard settings.

---

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

* 🖼 Images not showing? Place assets in `public/` or fix relative paths.
* 🔄 React Router refresh issue? Add rewrite rules (Vercel/Netlify auto-handle).
* 🚫 GitHub Pages + Router? Use HashRouter or custom redirects.
